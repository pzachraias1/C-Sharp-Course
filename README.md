C# repository for my homework and project

dotnet new console -use-program-main


Use vscode for this class. I generate c# program by typing the command "dotnet new console --use-program-main". Run the program by typing "dotnet run".

I created a Makefile that will run the program for me. Instead of typing "dotnet run", i am typing out "make"
